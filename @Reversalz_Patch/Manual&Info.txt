Step 1. Install NetLimiter by running the file "NetLimiter Installer!".

Step 2. Run the "Patcher" file as admin which will open a cmd prompt, now spam any key until the cmd prompt closes, now the installation will be done for you. 

Step 3. Go to "C:\Program Files\Locktime Software\NetLimiter" and find the file "@Reversalz" now make that file a shotcut or pin it to your taskbar for ease of use.

Step 4. Enjoy your Limiter <3 -Reversalz. (All Filters/Rules are already set up for you)

Potential issue 1 fix: If your Filters don't work you will have to edit your "application is" location on each Filter, Limiting Guide Part 1 shows how!
Potential Issue 2 fix: If your PC system is set to a different language than English, you will have to change it to English in the Settings of NetLimiter.
